Zombie Zapper is a website that aims to help people develop habitual behaviors so that they can reach their behavioral goals. Whether you want to start a new habit or stop an old one, zombie zapper provides a platform to explore new ideas and make commitments to certain behavior changes. Zombie Zapper is based on the idea of incorporating new behaviors into already ingrained habitual actions. There are things that we do every day, multiple times a day, that are so automatic that we rarely even think about them. We can use these anchor behaviors as a trigger for new, desired behaviors by committing to do a simple action every time we perform one of these anchor behaviors. 

How many times do you drink water in a day? What if, in order to slow things down, you committed to taking 3 deep, relaxed breaths every time you took a drink of water? Eventually you may find that drinking water is a very relaxing necessary activity, and you may notice a reduction in baseline anxiety. 

How many times do you urinate in a day? What if, in order to improve your fitness, you did two pushups after using the bathroom? Soon you may notice that two pushups is too easy, and you might up it to 5. Soon after that, you may notice that you feel more able to do pushups and your upper body strength might have improved without breaking a sweat.

How many times do you check facebook? What if, every time you checked facebook, you did a quick inventory of everything you would like to accomplish that day? Checking out social media can be a distraction, but committing to this new behavior might actually help you be less distracted overall!

Zombie Zapper allows users to post new ideas for habitual actions, in the form of: "Every time I _____, I will ______." Other users can browse through ideas and make commitments to ones that they think they can benefit from. Users can also comment on these ideas to share successes or difficulties.
